🎉 CHAT UI WEB SEARCH INTEGRATION TEST

Your chat UI endpoints have been updated with automatic web search!

✅ UPDATED ENDPOINTS:
   1. POST /chat - Regular chat (now with web search)
   2. POST /chat/stream - Streaming chat (now with web search)

✅ HOW IT WORKS:
   - When you ask questions needing current info, web search triggers automatically
   - Questions are analyzed to determine if they need real-time data
   - Web results are seamlessly integrated into the LLM context
   - You get comprehensive answers combining web data + RAG knowledge

✅ TRIGGER KEYWORDS:
   Questions containing these words will trigger web search:
   - "news", "today", "current", "latest", "now", "recent"
   - "what's happening", "update", "forecast"
   - "calendar", "event", "announcement"
   - "sentiment", "overview"

✅ EXAMPLES THAT TRIGGER WEB SEARCH:

   1. "What's the latest gold news?"
      → Searches for XAUUSD news

   2. "Show me today's economic calendar"
      → Fetches economic events

   3. "What is the current market sentiment for EURUSD?"
      → Gets market sentiment data

   4. "Give me an overview of the forex market today"
      → Fetches market overview

   5. "What's happening with Bitcoin now?"
      → Searches for Bitcoin news

✅ EXAMPLES THAT USE RAG ONLY (no web search):

   1. "What is RSI indicator?"
      → Uses historical knowledge

   2. "Explain moving averages"
      → Uses technical knowledge

   3. "Analyze this price data"
      → Uses uploaded file + knowledge

✅ TO TEST IN YOUR BROWSER:

   1. Start the server:
      python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload

   2. Open: http://localhost:8080

   3. Login with your credentials

   4. Try asking: "What's the latest gold news?"

   5. Watch the console logs for:
      🌐 Web search triggered - fetching real-time information
      📰 Fetched news for XAUUSD

✅ CONSOLE LOG INDICATORS:

   When web search is active, you'll see these emoji indicators:
   🌐 - Web search triggered
   📰 - News fetched for symbol
   📅 - Economic calendar fetched
   📊 - Market sentiment fetched
   🌍 - Market overview fetched
   🔍 - General web search performed

✅ WHAT'S CHANGED:

   BEFORE:
   User: "What's the latest gold news?"
   System: Uses only RAG knowledge (may be outdated)

   AFTER:
   User: "What's the latest gold news?"
   System:
   1. Detects "latest" and "news" keywords
   2. Searches DuckDuckGo for real-time XAUUSD news
   3. Combines web results with RAG knowledge
   4. Provides comprehensive, up-to-date answer

✅ BENEFITS:

   - ✓ Seamless integration (works automatically)
   - ✓ No UI changes needed (backend handles everything)
   - ✓ Smart detection (only searches when needed)
   - ✓ Privacy-focused (uses DuckDuckGo)
   - ✓ Free (no API costs)
   - ✓ Fast (results in seconds)
   - ✓ Comprehensive (web + RAG combined)

✅ SUPPORTED QUERIES:

   News:
   - "gold news", "XAUUSD news", "Bitcoin news"

   Market Data:
   - "market sentiment", "market overview"
   - "economic calendar", "economic events"

   Forecasts:
   - "gold forecast", "EURUSD prediction"
   - "market analysis today"

   General:
   - Any query with "today", "latest", "current", "now"
