Risk Disclosure:

Futures and forex trading involve substantial risk and may not be suitable for every investor.

An investor could potentially lose all or more than their initial investment. Risk capital refers

to funds that can be lost without impacting one's financial security or lifestyle. Trading should

only  be  done  with  risk  capital,  and  only  those  with  sufficient  risk  capital  should  consider

trading. Past performance does not necessarily predict future results.

Hypothetical Performance Disclosure:

Hypothetical performance results come with several inherent limitations, some of which are

explained below. There is no assurance that any account will achieve profits or losses similar

to those depicted. Often, there are significant differences between hypothetical performance

results  and  the  actual  results  achieved  by  any  specific  trading  program.  One  limitation  of

hypothetical  performance  results  is  that  they  are  typically  prepared  with  the  benefit  of

hindsight.  Furthermore,  hypothetical  trading  does  not  involve  real  financial  risk,  and  no

hypothetical trading record can fully consider the impact of actual financial risk. Factors such

as the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a specific trading program, despite losses, are

essential and can negatively affect actual trading results. Many other market-related factors or

the  execution  of  any  specific  trading  program  cannot  be  entirely  accounted  for  in  the

preparation of hypothetical performance results and can adversely affect trading outcomes.

This  book  is  solely  for  educational  purposes,  and  the  expressed  opinions  are  those  of  the

author  alone.  All  presented  trades  should  be  considered  hypothetical  and  have  not  been

executed in a live account.

About me

Hi, I'm Dale, and I've been a full-time trader since 2008. I've always been very passionate about

economics,  finance,  and  trading.  I  went  to  university  for  finance,  and  I  got  certified  as  a

portfolio  manager  and  investment  manager.  I  also  obtained  certification  in  financial

derivatives. I'm proud to say that I have received proper education and certification, unlike the

majority of other trading 'gurus.'

After college, I worked as a market analyst for a big brokerage, but I didn't stay long because I

wanted to focus on my dream of being a full-time trader. From then on, I spent 12-15 hours

every  day  testing  different  trading  strategies,  trying  various  approaches,  and  analyzing

patterns. I traded all sorts of things like stocks, investment certificates, and automated trading

systems. Right now, my main focus is manual forex trading.

When I first started trading forex, I thought I needed to find a secret Holy Grail strategy that

would make me a lot of money fast. I searched for this among different trading indicators. I

tried most of the common indicators with various settings, but none of them really worked in

the long run.

My first real success came when I ditched all the indicators and started fresh with simple Price

Action. It was the first time I felt like I was making progress. The breakthrough moment was

when  I  combined  Price Action  with  Volume  Profile.  That's  when  I  started  to  see  consistent

results.

5

Later on, I looked for ways to improve my trading even more, especially in terms of timing my

trades,  confirming  them,  and  finding  strong  combos  of  trade  setups.  That's  when  I  added

Order Flow and VWAP to my trading toolbox. I chose these because they both  are volume-

based indicators, which let me follow the big trading institutions that move the markets, rather

than going against them.

In 2016, I started a website called www.trader-dale.com, where I teach people how to trade

like I do through in-depth courses.

My courses cover Volume Profile trading, Order Flow trading, VWAP trading, and long-term

investing. I provide custom-made indicators to my course members, including Volume Profile,

Order Flow, VWAP, Trade Manager, Stock fundamentals indicator, Portfolio Tracker, and more.

Besides my website, I've written a couple of books that quickly became bestsellers on Amazon.

The books are:

•  VOLUME PROFILE: The Insider’s Guide to Trading

•  ORDER FLOW: Trading Setups

•  Stock Investing with Volume Profile

You can also find me on other websites like www.volumeprofile.com, www.orderflow.com, and

www.vwap.com, in addition to my main page, www.trader-dale.com.

Introduction to VWAP

VWAP, which stands for Value Weighted Average Price, is essentially an average price that takes

into account the trading volume. It provides insight into where the average trader placed their

orders.

If you find that the current price is above the VWAP and you've recently made a purchase, it

means  you  bought  at  a  price  higher  than  what  the  average  trader  did.  VWAP  serves  as  a

valuable reference point for traders.

What sets VWAP apart from other standard indicators like SMA (Simple Moving Average) or

EMA  (Exponential  Moving  Average)  is  the  way  it  calculates.  While  SMA,  EMA,  and  similar

indicators  rely  solely  on  time  and  price  data,  VWAP  incorporates  trading  volume  into  its

calculation. This additional dimension of volume information makes VWAP a standout tool in

technical analysis.

Here is the formula:

Is this too theoretical? Let me give you an example to make the difference clear.

Example #1:

Imagine there were 1.000 shares traded at $10, and 5.000 shares traded at $20.

SMA = ($10 + $20)/2 = $15

VWAP = (($10 x 1.000) + ($20 x 5.000)) / 6.000 = $18.33

I can make the example even more extreme to show you how much SMA and VWAP can differ,

and how misleading SMA could be.

8

Example #2:

Imagine there were only 100 shares traded at $5, and 5.000 shares traded at $20.

SMA = ($5+$20)/2 = $12.5

VWAP = (($5 x 100) + ($20 x 5.000)) / 5.100 = $19.7

Now,  let's  consider  which  indicator  better  reflects  the  market  reality  –  SMA  or  VWAP.  The

answer  is  clear:  VWAP!  Why?  Because  VWAP  represents  the  REAL  average  of  all  market

participants,  making  it  significantly  distinct  and  more  valuable  than  SMA,  EMA,  and  other

similar indicators.

Why does VWAP work?

Here are some significant facts to consider:

Fact  #1:  The  majority  of  trading  orders  in  the  financial  markets  come  from  large  trading

institutions.

Fact #2: These trading institutions primarily use automated systems or algorithms to execute

their trades.

Fact #3 (the key point): What's noteworthy is that many of these automated systems rely on

VWAP as part of their trading strategies. Each institution may have its own unique approach,

techniques, and goals when using VWAP, but the widespread use of VWAP-based systems in

global trading is a critical factor to acknowledge.

By the way, to support these facts, you can refer to statements made by Kenneth Griffin, CEO

of Citadel, one of the largest trading institutions, during his testimony before the Committee

on Financial Services in the United States. This proves the significance of VWAP in the world

of finance.

9

•  “Today,  virtually  all  trades  executed  by  institutional  investors  are  in  the  form  of

program trades such as volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and other algorithmic

trades.”

•  “These VWAP trades are not large trades that you can—it’s not like there’s 10 million

shares to be bought. It is a trade that is sliced into small slices, 100 or 200 shares, and

executed over the course of a day, a week, or a month.”

•  “We  use  VWAP  orders  to  execute  on  behalf  of  our  hedge  fund  and  have  generated

exceptional returns for pension plans and for endowments.”

Here is the official source: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-

Where to get VWAP

Unfortunately, neither VWAP nor Anchored VWAP is a standard indicator typically included in

every trading platform. You can either search the internet for free versions of these indicators,

although they often vary in quality, or you can purchase them from various vendors.

The most cost-effective option is to use the TradingView charting platform. However, the free

version does not include these indicators, so you will need to purchase a subscription. The

most  affordable  option,  called  "Essentials,"  should  suffice.  You  can  subscribe  here:

www.tradingview.com

Another option is to purchase my VWAP Pack, which includes a 9-hour VWAP video course as

well as my custom-made indicators for NinjaTrader 8, TradingView, and Metatrader 4 & 5. The

advantage  of  this  package  is  that  my  indicators  are  compatible  with  the  free  versions  of

NinjaTrader and TradingView, so there are no additional costs beyond the initial purchase. This

purchase includes a lifetime license and can be used on multiple computers.

VWAP Trading strategies

In the next chapter, I'll explain my VWAP trading strategies. You can use these strategies for

any type of trading, with any kind of trading instrument and timeframe.

My  favorite  trading  instruments  for  intraday  trading  are  major  forex  pairs  like  EUR/USD,

AUD/USD, GBP/USD, and also indexes like the S&P 500. When it comes to longer-term or swing

trading, I also include stocks.

For intraday trading, I prefer using 5 or 30-minute timeframes, and for swing trading, I prefer

the Daily timeframe.

You don't have to learn all of these strategies at once; it might be too overwhelming. I suggest

choosing a couple that you like and feel comfortable with, and starting with those.

Strategy #1 – Reactions to VWAP

Strategy description

The main idea behind my VWAP trading strategy is trading pullbacks to VWAP.

 Simply put – I wait for the price to move away from VWAP, and when it comes back to test it

again, I anticipate that VWAP will work as either a Support or Resistance level. For example, as

shown here:

11

VWAP

Price  makes  a  pullback  to  VWAP.
Enter a Short trade from here.

In the picture above, you'll notice a blue line - VWAP. When the price moves below this line

and then retraces to test it, VWAP often acts as a Resistance level.

Why does this happen? It's because VWAP represents the trading position of an average trader,

and many market participants use it as a reference point for their trade entries.

Imagine you want to enter a Short trade on the EUR/USD. The market is in a downtrend, and

prices are dropping. Where's the best place to enter your Short position? It's not wise to enter

randomly  or  at  the  current  daily  low.  The  logical  entry  point  is  where  the  average  market

participant sold, which is typically around VWAP. Institutional traders, the big players, follow a

similar  principle.  In  a  hedge  fund  or  a  bank,  supervisors  might  instruct  traders  to  "Short  X

amount of lots on EUR/USD today, and do it at VWAP or better," with "better" meaning a price

above VWAP.

When the price reaches VWAP, traders start entering their Short positions, causing the price

to  move  away  from  VWAP  once  again.  This  is  how  markets  operate  and  why  VWAP  often

functions as a Support or Resistance zone.

Returning to the image above, when the price hit VWAP from below, aggressive sellers began

opening their Short positions, leading to a downward movement in the price.

12

Anchoring VWAP

Until now, I've explained that VWAP represents an average market participant, but I haven't

clarified over what time period this average is calculated. This is where it can get a bit tricky

because it's your choice to determine that period.

If  you  set  the  VWAP's  starting  point  at  the  beginning  of  the  trading  day,  it  will  reflect  the

average trader's position since the start of that day.

Start  of  the  day.  Here  is  where  the
Daily VWAP starts its calculation

The  Daily  VWAP  represents  an  average
trade since the start of the day.

The chart displayed above shows ES (S&P 500 futures) on a 5-minute timeframe. In this chart,

you  can  see  VWAP anchored  at  the beginning  of  the  trading  day, representing  the  average

trader's position since the start of the day.

This particular VWAP, anchored at the start of the day, is commonly referred to as the "Daily

VWAP" and is widely used in trading.

However, it's important to note that VWAP can be anchored in various ways. What all these

anchoring methods share in common is their placement at crucial points in the market – points

where market participants make crucial decisions, where sentiments shift, and the rules of the

game  change.  These  are  the  most  critical  locations  to  anchor  your  VWAP,  as  they  provide

valuable insights into how the average trader perceives the situation since those significant

turning points.

13

First, let's provide you with a list of these crucial anchoring points, and then we'll delve deeper

into each one of them for a better understanding.

The most important places to anchor the VWAP:

•  Beginning of: Day, Week, Year

•

Important swing point

•  Start of a trend

•  Strong macro news

•  Heavy volume zone

•  Gap

•  Earnings

The strategy

The basic idea behind trading with Anchored VWAP is easy to understand. You just wait for the

price to move away from the VWAP line, and when it touches the VWAP again, that's your

signal to enter a trade.

For a Long trade:

If the price is above VWAP (meaning buyers are in control) and it comes back down to VWAP

from above, that's when you enter a Long position as the price touches VWAP.

14

Long

Long

For a Short trade:

If the price is under VWAP (showing that sellers are in charge) and it comes back up to VWAP

from below, that's your signal to enter a Short position as the price touches VWAP.

Short

Short

This is the most basic way to trade with VWAP. Personally, I like to see a bit more before making

a  trade,  such as  trade  confirmation  and  alignment  with  other  trading  strategies.  I'll  explain

15

these later, but for now, let's focus on the fundamentals so you don't feel overwhelmed right

from the beginning.

Anchoring VWAP to dates

Start of the Day

This is the most traditional and widely used method of anchoring the VWAP.

When VWAP is anchored at the start of the trading day, it's referred to as the "Daily VWAP."

Day  traders,  in  particular,  find  this  useful  as  they  seek  multiple  trading  opportunities

throughout the day.

You can choose a time frame anywhere from 1-minute to 1-hour, but my personal preference

for trading with the Daily VWAP is the 5-minute time frame.

The VWAP calculation begins at the start of the Asian trading session and concludes at the end

of the US trading session.

16

Example #1 (Daily VWAP)

Take a look at this example of EUR/USD on a 5-minute chart with the Daily VWAP. You'll notice

that for most of the day, the market stayed above the VWAP line, indicating that buyers were

in charge.

At various points, the price came back to the VWAP line, which acted like a solid Support level,

and the price responded well to it.

from this point.

End of the Day (close

Daily VWAP ends its
calculation here.

The image above displays the Daily VWAP, which begins during the Asian session and stops at

the end of the US session. After that, I don't use this VWAP for trading anymore. Instead, I

transition to trading with the new Daily VWAP that starts forming as the new Asian session

kicks off.

17

Example #2 (Daily VWAP)

Let's look at an example on GBP/USD, using a 5-minute chart. The price spent most of the day

above the Daily VWAP, indicating that buyers were in charge. Whenever the price pulled back

to  VWAP,  it  presented  a  potential  opportunity  for  a  Long  trade,  and  buyers  often  took

advantage of these chances to buy at VWAP.

When you're trading intraday with VWAP, it's important to understand that the price may not

always  react  exactly  when  it  touches  the  VWAP  line.  It  might  go  a  bit  past  VWAP  before

responding, and that's perfectly normal.

It can also happen for the price to simply pass by VWAP without any significant reaction. This

is part of trading, as there's no strategy that works perfectly all the time.

Price is reacting to Daily VWAP

18

Example #3 Daily VWAP

Take a look at this 5-Minute chart of GBP/USD. I want to show you how a "broken" VWAP can

still be useful.

In this example, the first part of the day belonged to the buyers. The price was above VWAP,

and whenever it touched VWAP, there was a reaction.

But  then,  something  changed.  The  price  broke  through  VWAP,  turning  what  used  to  be  a

Support into a Resistance. What does this mean for us as traders?

Instead of seeking Long trades, we now search for Short trades. We want to see the price touch

VWAP from below and go short from there.

However, if the price breaks above VWAP again, and the Buyers regain control, then we start

looking for Long trades once more.

In simple terms, if the price is above VWAP, it acts as Support. If the price is below VWAP, it

becomes  a  Resistance.  This  can  happen  several  times  in  a  day!  Personally,  I  prefer  when  it

doesn't  happen  too  often  and  when  markets  are  trending  clearly  in  one  direction,  but  in

trading, things are rarely perfect.

Start of the week

A VWAP that starts at the beginning of the trading week (at the start of the Asian Session on

Monday) is known as the Weekly VWAP. It's one of my favorites, especially when I'm trading

intraday with a 30-minute time frame.

I  find  it  more  effective  than  the  Daily  VWAP  because,  in  my  experience,  it  provides  better

trading signals. At least on the 30-minute time frame, which I prefer for intraday trading.

I always have the Weekly VWAP on my trading workspace, and I like to combine its signals with

those from Volume Profile (we'll discuss this more later).

Now, let's look at a couple of trade examples using the Weekly VWAP.

Example #1 (Weekly VWAP)

Here's an example of a Weekly VWAP on a 30-minute chart for Gold. Gold prices have been

falling all week, staying below the VWAP. This suggests that sellers were in control. There were

a few times when the price went back up to the VWAP, and, except for the last one, each time

it led to a successful reaction.

The end of

Based on my experience, VWAP performs exceptionally well in trending markets like this one,

allowing us to use VWAP pullbacks as entry points in the direction of the trend.

20

Example #2 (Weekly VWAP)

Here's  an  example  of  Weekly  VWAP  on  a  30-minute  EUR/USD  chart.  Initially,  buyers

dominated,  and  we  looked  for  Long  trades  when  the  price  touched  VWAP  from  above.

However, a major news event shifted the market sentiment. The price quickly crossed below

VWAP, turning VWAP into a Resistance. This Resistance level was tested on Friday.

develop a bit before trading it.

Start of the year

A VWAP that begins on the first day of the year and ends on the last day is known as the Yearly

VWAP. It's one of my top choices for swing trading or long-term trading, and I typically use it

on a Daily timeframe (1 candle represents 1 day).

The Yearly VWAP helps us see how the average trader has been performing since the start of

the year and where the "fair" price for the year is.

I always include the Yearly VWAP on my charts when analyzing swing trades. I like to combine

it with my Volume Profile strategies (I'll explain more about that later).

Now, let's take a look at a few trade examples using the Yearly VWAP.

21

Example #1 (Yearly VWAP)

This is a Yearly VWAP on a Daily chart of Exxon Mobil stock. From the beginning of the year,

the price has been above the Yearly VWAP, indicating that buyers have been dominating. The

strategy is straightforward: wait for price pullbacks to VWAP and enter a Long trade when the

price touches the VWAP line from above.

As  you  can  see,  VWAP  is  useful  not  only  for  forex  trading  but  also  for  other  types  of

instruments.

Long

The start of the year

See how VWAP works well as a strong Support line. If the market wasn't in a trend, this strategy

would be much more challenging to trade.

22

Example #2 (Yearly VWAP)

Sometimes, the trend is so strong and steep that the VWAP line stays far away from the current

price most of the time, and trading opportunities come up only occasionally. This is the case

in the example below, where there were only two instances of price pulling back to the VWAP.

The first reaction was excellent and allowed for trailing the short trade.

The second reaction might appear small, but remember, we're looking at a Daily timeframe,

and in reality, it resulted in about a 200-pip movement.

Short

The start

As you might agree, having only two trades per year isn't too much. That's why I trade a variety

of  forex  pairs,  stocks,  and  other  instruments,  and  I  also use different  trading  strategies.  If I

focused solely on a few instruments and this strategy, I could easily end up with just a couple

of trades for the entire year.

23

Anchoring VWAP to swing points

One of my favorite ways to use VWAP effectively is by anchoring it at key swing points in the

market.  These swing  points  are  moments  where  the  market  sentiment  shifted  significantly,

essentially  changing  the  rules  of  the  game.  While  there  isn't  an  exact  definition  for  these

points, they are typically easy to spot once you're familiar with them, and practice will help

you identify them on a chart.

These important highs and lows serve as pivotal decision-making points for traders. They are

widely recognized and acted upon by majority of traders in the market, making them excellent

reference points for anchoring VWAP.

In simple terms, think of a significant high or low as a crucial event that many traders in the

market takes note of. VWAP then tells you whether the price is currently above or below the

"fair" or "average" price since that game-changing moment, helping traders make informed

decisions. Let's explore a couple of examples to illustrate this concept.

24

Example #1: VWAP anchored at swing point

In the example below, you'll see a 30-minute chart of S&P 500 futures. I chose to anchor the

VWAP  at  the  lowest  point  on  the  chart,  which  marked  the  pivotal  moment  when  the

downtrend reversed, giving way to an uptrend. This specific swing point is the ideal reference

for anchoring your VWAP.

From that point onward, the price interacted with this anchored VWAP on three occasions,

each time yielding a precise and favorable response. In all these instances, this VWAP acted as

a reliable Support level.

An important swing point

Long

The  great  thing  about  anchoring  VWAP  at  a swing point  is  that  it works  well  with different

timeframes in trading. You can find key swing points on a daily chart and use VWAP for daily

swing trading. Or, you can use it for intraday trading on a 5-minute chart.

Just remember, if you analyze on a daily chart and anchor VWAP there, stick to trading on the

daily time frame. Use Stop Loss and Take Profit levels suitable for that timeframe to keep your

strategy consistent and effective.

25

Example #2: VWAP anchored at swing point

This is a daily chart of Apple stock. At the beginning of 2023, there was a significant low point

(swing point). This marked the moment when a downtrend changed into an uptrend, a crucial

event that influenced investors' decisions.

During the uptrend that followed, the price mostly remained above the VWAP, indicating that

buyers  were  in  control.  However,  when  it  eventually  pulled  back  and  touched  the  VWAP,

something  interesting  happened.  The  VWAP  acted  as  strong  Support,  and  the  price

immediately responded to this Support level.

When the price hit the VWAP, it attracted buyers  looking for a good price. Their aggressive

buying activity helped push the price higher once again.

 Example #3: VWAP anchored at swing point

This example is quite unusual because it involves a dramatic swing point. There was a sudden

and  large  drop  in  the  USD/JPY  currency  pair,  which  can  happen  unexpectedly  with  the  JPY

currency. However, this sharp drop was quickly reversed when aggressive buyers stepped in,

causing  the  price  to  rise  again.  All  of  this  price  action  resulted  in  a  very  noticeable  and

significant swing low, one that's hard to miss.

In such cases, it's a good idea to use the VWAP tool and anchor it at the candle that marked

this strong low point. Later on, you'll see that the VWAP line drawn from this point acted as a

Support level, and the price reacted to it multiple times. Below, you can see a 5-minute chart

illustrating this.

Anchoring VWAP to start of the trend

Another crucial moment in trading is the beginning of a trend. When a strong trend emerges,

every trader needs to adapt. Some want to find the perfect time to join the trend and jump in,

while others, if the trend goes against them, seek a suitable exit point for their losing trades.

What  both  groups  have  in  common  is  their  desire  to  do  this  at  the  "fair"  price,  which  is

represented by the VWAP. The challenge here is pinpointing where the trend actually began.

It  can  be  somewhat  subjective;  two  traders  might  choose different  candles  on  the  chart  to

27

anchor  their  VWAP.  Typically,  this  doesn't  lead  to  significant  differences,  and  the  VWAP

provides similar Support and Resistance levels. However, if two traders anchor their VWAPs to

candles that are too far apart, their VWAP lines may diverge more.

Here's how I do it: I consider a big candle near the point where the trend started as the starting

point. The larger the candle, the more significant it is for me. Let's explore some examples to

illustrate this concept.

Example #1: VWAP anchored to start of the trend

In the image below, you can see a 30-minute chart of S&P 500 futures, where a significant

downtrend is beginning. This downtrend starts with a large red candle, and I decided to anchor

my  VWAP  at  this  point.  The  trades  in  this  example  were  straightforward  because  the  price

remained below the VWAP throughout (indicating that sellers were in control), and the VWAP

consistently acted as a strong resistance, never failing even once.

Example #2: VWAP anchored to start of the trend

In this next example, we're looking at the NZD/USD currency pair on a 30-minute chart. This

scenario is a bit more complex because there's a change in the trend. Initially, there was a

downtrend, and the price had two significant reactions to the VWAP as resistance. But then,

something interesting happened—the price surged above the VWAP line, transforming it from

a Resistance into a new Support.

At this Support level, traders who were previously selling in the downtrend wanted to exit their

trades at a "fair price" (which is represented by the VWAP). This desire to exit at a fair price

played a key role in causing the price to react to this new Support level on two occasions.

In this next example, we're looking at the DAX stock index on a daily chart. I want to show that

the VWAP trading approach works for all types of trading instruments and timeframes.

The  image  below  illustrates  the  beginning  of  a  trend,  marked  by  a  strong  and  clear  bullish

candle. This is where I anchored my VWAP.

After anchoring it there, the VWAP consistently acted as a strong Support level. There were

two good opportunities for trade entries from this point onward.

Example #4: VWAP anchored to start of the trend

In this final example, we're looking at Bitcoin on a 5-minute chart. There was a powerful and

rapid upward movement, characterized by a massive green candle (which Bitcoin is known for

on occasion). If you anchored the VWAP at this candle, it presented one good opportunity for

a trade entry. Unfortunately, this new uptrend didn't last long. Two things occurred during the

first pullback to the VWAP:

Buyers who wanted to join the rising market jumped in at what they considered the "fair price"

(which is represented by the VWAP). This influx of buyers helped push the price higher.

Sellers who found themselves in an unfavorable position due to the sudden move needed to

exit their trades. How did they do it? By buying, which is the action required to close a short

trade. This also contributed to driving the price upward.

So, in this case, there are two factors that contributed to the price moving up from the VWAP.

Shortly after that, the VWAP line, which was acting as Support before, was broken, and sellers

entered the market. When the price crossed below the VWAP, it transformed into a resistance.

At this moment, the VWAP became a level where sellers wanted to sell (at a "fair price"), and

buyers who saw that the uptrend was ending and wanted to exit their long positions did so at

this point. That's why the VWAP worked as a Resistance in this case.

31

Anchoring VWAP to macro news candle

Many trading decisions are influenced by major macro news and important economic events.

That's why I prefer to anchor the VWAP at the candle where significant and game-changing

news was released.

There are two important things to keep in mind:

Firstly, you need to be able to identify which macro news is truly important. The easiest way

to do this is by checking www.forex-factory.com, which uses colors to mark macro news events.

Yellow  indicates  low-impact  news,  orange  is  medium-impact,  and  red  is  high-impact.  I

recommend using this strategy primarily for high-impact (red) news.

Not  all  high-impact  news  events  are  equally  strong  in  moving  the  market.  For  example,

"Unemployment Claims" is marked as high-impact news but may not have a significant impact

on the market. On the other hand, "Monetary Policy Statement" is extremely powerful news.

Unfortunately, Forex Factory assigns them the same level of importance. So, don't anchor your

VWAP  at  the  candle  where  "Unemployment  Claims"  was  released,  but  definitely  anchor  it

where "Monetary Policy Statement" was released.

We want strong macro news that creates volatility and a significant shift in market sentiment.

Here's a list of the most crucial news events that are likely to do just that and are ideal for

anchoring VWAP:

•  Rate decision and Minimum Bid Rate (including the following press conference)

•  FOMC Meeting and Monetary Policy Statement (with the following press conference)

•  CPI (Consumer Price Index)

•  GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

•  NFP (Non-Farm Employment Change)

•  Unemployment Rate

32

•  Speeches by the leaders of major economies discussing topics directly affecting their

economy and currency.

The TradingView platform has a useful feature that displays strong macro news events below

the chart, making it easy to find the candles associated with these events.

If you can't see this feature on your chart, you can enable it in the chart settings by selecting

"economic events on the chart."

Secondly, it's essential to understand that even the most significant news may not always alter

the market's mood. You're looking for macro news that kickstarts action, like a new trend. If

the news only makes the price briefly jump up and down before settling back to its previous

33

state, then it wasn't the game-changing news you were seeking (so, no need to anchor the

VWAP there).

Here's an example of strong macro news that didn't impact the market sentiment:

Strong news but no
reaction

34

Here's  an  example  of  an  important  macro news event  that  changed  the market  sentiment,

making it a good choice to anchor your VWAP to:

Strong news with a
strong reaction

In a nutshell, anchor your VWAP to candles that resulted from powerful macro news and led

to significant market movements. This shows that the macro news was truly a game-changer,

and other traders will base their decisions on this event.

I  personally  use  this  trading  method  for  my  short-term  trades,  which  means  I  focus  on

timeframes ranging from 5 minutes to 30 minutes. Here are a few examples:

35

Example #1: VWAP anchored to macro news candle

In the chart below, you can see a 30-minute timeframe of the EUR/USD forex pair. This currency

pair is greatly influenced by macro news from both the EU and US. One of the most impactful

pieces of news is the Interest Rate Decision. This macro news has the potential to completely

reshape trends and market sentiment, not only in the short-term for intraday trading but also

in the long run.

In this case, the Interest Rate Decision sparked a fresh uptrend. I chose to anchor the VWAP at

the  candle  corresponding  to  this  significant  macro  news  event.  A  few  days  later,  the  price

retraced back to the VWAP, resulting in some favorable reactions and trade opportunities.

Here's an example on a 30-minute chart of USD/JPY. It shows a bullish candle caused by the

"BoJ (Bank of Japan) Interest Rate Decision." This candle marked the beginning of a trend and

was a definite game-changer. Shortly after, there was the first pullback to the VWAP, providing

a great chance to join the trend and capture the momentum triggered by the macro news.

Later  on,  there  were  two  more  opportunities  for  long  trades,  but  unfortunately,  the

momentum had faded. The price still reacted to the VWAP, but these were just quick in-and-

out trades with no trailing.

When  the  price  dropped  below  the  VWAP,  it  then  acted  as  resistance,  offering  a  quick

opportunity for a short trade.

Anchoring VWAP to heavy volume zones

Heavy volume zones are crucial areas on a chart where large trading institutions have been

actively placing many orders. These zones hold significant importance because it's these big

players who have the ability to influence and even manipulate the markets.

To identify these heavy volume zones effectively, the best tool to use is Volume Profile. It's not

a standard feature found in most trading platforms by default. You can obtain Volume Profile

tools  from  my  website  at  www.trader-dale.com  or  www.volumeprofile.com.  My  Volume

Profile indicators are compatible with TradingView, NinjaTrader 8, and MetaTrader 4 platforms.

They  are  user-friendly,  extensively  tested,  and  if  you  encounter  any  technical  issues,  our

dedicated support team is available to assist you promptly.

Volume Profile can take on various shapes, and the one shown below is just one example:

Volume Profile indicator

I  use  my  Volume  Profile  indicator  to  identify  heavy  volume  zones,  typically  found  in  areas

where  the  price  was  consolidating.  This  is  because  major  institutions  prefer  to  slowly  and

discreetly accumulate their positions during these consolidation phases.

These rotation zones are usually followed by a clear trend, and this trend reveals the intentions

of these large players:

38

If a rotation zone with heavy volumes is followed by an uptrend, it indicates that significant

institutional buyers were quietly accumulating their long positions during the consolidation.

On the other hand, if a rotation zone with heavy volumes precedes a downtrend, it suggests

that  major  institutional  sellers  were  discreetly  building  their  short  positions  during  the

consolidation.

The image below perfectly illustrates the scenario I prefer to trade. It shows a rotation zone

with  heavy  volumes  followed  by  a  trend,  indicating  that  strong  institutional  buyers

accumulated their long positions in the consolidation zone and then drove (manipulated) the

price upward.

An uptrend starting
from the rotation

A rotation where heavy
volumes were traded

The trading approach here is to anchor the VWAP at the end of the consolidation zone, right

where the trend begins. After that, you trade it as usual, jumping in at the pullbacks.

The beauty of this strategy is that it's applicable to any timeframe and any trading instrument.

It's a universal approach that works whether you're looking at a 5-minute chart of EUR/USD or

a  daily  chart  of  Tesla  stocks.  What's  really  great  about  Volume  Profile  and  VWAP  is  their

universality—the strategy remains the same regardless of the charts or instruments you use.

Now, let's dive into some examples to clarify things further!

39

Example #1: VWAP anchored to a heavy volume zone

This is a daily chart of Bitcoin. It shows a region on the chart where a lot of trading happened,

and it looks like strong buyers were active in that area. They were slowly buying up Bitcoin for

the long term.

When they really took charge and started pushing the price higher, it marked the beginning of

an upward trend. This is the point where you should anchor the VWAP

As the price stayed above the VWAP, it meant that the buyers were in control. Then, there was

a pullback, creating a good opportunity to enter a long trade and join the uptrend.

first  large  bullish  candle.  From  this  point,  the  market  offers  three  chances  to  enter  a  good

trade: look for price pullbacks to the VWAP during the uptrend.

Example #3: VWAP anchored to a heavy volume zone

Below is a 30-minute chart of the S&P 500 index (futures). It shows a rotation zone where a

lot of trading happened. During this time, big traders were accumulating their short positions.

After  that,  the  market  started to  drop  in price, which  means  those big traders  were  selling

aggressively.

To use the VWAP effectively, it's best to anchor it at the beginning of this drop. This is when

you see the first big red candle that marks the start of the downtrend.

From that point on, the price kept staying below the VWAP line, indicating that the sellers were

in control. During this time, there were three chances to enter at the pullback to the VWAP

and sell along with these big traders.

Volume Profile is a powerful trading tool that has various applications beyond VWAP. It can be

used for institutional trading strategies, determining where to set Take Profit and Stop Loss,

managing your positions, and more.

If you want to learn more about using Volume Profile effectively, I've written a book called

"Volume Profile: The Insider's Guide to Trading." You can get a free download of the book at

Anchoring VWAP to gaps

A gap occurs when the closing price of one candle is different from the opening price of the

next candle. Gaps are more common in stocks because stock markets are not open 24/5 like

some other instruments, such as currencies, which are traded continuously.

gap

That's why this trading strategy primarily focuses on trading stocks. When it comes to the time

frame, you have flexibility. You can use it for intraday trading, like on a 5 to 30-minute chart,

or for long-term position trading with daily charts.

In either case, the key is to look for big gaps. These gaps are key points where many traders

and investors base their decisions. When there's a big gap, everyone's attention is on it. Traders

are  assessing  how  their  trades  are  performing  compared  to  the  average  trade  or,  in  other

words, the fair price established after the significant gap. That's why a gap makes for a good

anchoring point for the VWAP.

To  implement  this  strategy,  you  need  to  analyze  charts  and  identify  these  gaps.  Then,  you

anchor the VWAP to the first candle after the gap, which is the opening candle. After that, you

execute trades by looking for pullbacks to the VWAP, following the same approach as in the

other trading scenarios we've discussed previously. Here are a couple of examples:

43

Example #1: VWAP anchored to a gap

The example below shows a 30 Minute chart of Apple stock. There is a big opening gap and

VWAP is anchored to the first candle after the gap. The price is moving most of the time above

the VWAP, reacting to it nicely.

Anchoring VWAP to earnings

Anchoring  VWAP  to  earnings  is  a  strategy  that  applies  exclusively  to  stocks.  It's  somewhat

related to our previous strategy where we anchored the VWAP to gaps. The reason for this

connection is that the most significant and impactful gaps often happen right after earnings

reports.

Here's how this strategy works: Start by opening a chart of the stock you want to trade and

locate  the  earnings  reports.  If  you  are  using  the  TradingView  platform,  this  is  quite

straightforward, as earnings dates are displayed at the bottom of the chart. Anchor the VWAP

to the point where the earnings report was released, and then trade pullbacks to the VWAP,

following your usual approach.

45

You have the flexibility to apply this strategy on any time frame. I personally prefer the daily

time frame, but you can also use it if you're an intraday trader, opting for shorter time frames

like 5 or 30 minutes.

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate the concept:

Example #1: VWAP anchored to earnings

The chart below displays Meta stock on a daily time frame. After an earnings report, the day

started  with  a  significant  gap.  Since  then,  the  buyers  were  leading  the  way,  as  the  price

consistently stayed above the VWAP line. Additionally, the price reacted each time it touched

the VWAP.

There  have  been  two  more  earnings  reports  after  the  one  where  I  anchored  the  pullback.

However, none of them resulted in such a substantial gap or surprised traders as much as this

particular earnings report. That's why I consider this earnings report and gap to be much more

significant than the others you can see on the chart.

Example #2: VWAP anchored to earnings

The image below displays a 5-minute chart of Walmart stock. It's important to note that in a

5-minute time frame, the chart is more volatile compared to, let's say, a daily chart.

Following an earnings report, there was a big gap when the market opened. Once the initial

volatility  settled,  the  price  mostly  remained  below  the  VWAP  line.  This  suggests  that  even

though the earnings news was positive, sellers had the upper hand, driving the price down.

After the initial volatility calmed down, there were three chances to enter a Short trade and

make money on the downward movement.

Strategy #2: Reactions to 1st VWAP deviations

Until now, we've discussed strategies where the price responds to the VWAP line. Now, I'd like

to introduce you to strategies that rely on VWAP standard deviations.

VWAP deviations, often referred to as "bands," consist of two lines positioned both above and

below the VWAP line. These lines move alongside the VWAP and are calculated based on it.

The easiest way to make use of these deviations is to recognize whether the market is in a

trend or a rotation. If the deviations are moving horizontally, it indicates that the market is in

a rotation:

47

1st (upper) Deviation

VWAP

1st (lower) deviation

When the deviations move vertically, at least one of them, it signals that the market is in a

trend:

1st deviation is moving
vertically (= trend)

VWAP

1st deviation is moving
vertically (= trend)

Distinguishing  between  a  rotation  and  a  trend  using  this  method  is  user-friendly  but  not

foolproof. While it's not flawless in every situation, it does provide valuable insights into the

market's current state at a quick glance.

48

There are two strategies that rely on the 1st VWAP deviations. One is designed for trading in a

market that is in rotation, while the other is tailored for trading in a trending market.

The setting

Before we delve into the two strategies, let me provide a quick note about the settings I use

when trading with the 1st VWAP deviations.

I exclusively use the 1st deviations in conjunction with VWAP anchored to specific dates. This

means VWAP anchored to the start of a day, week, or year. While it's not incorrect to use them

with VWAP anchored to other reference points like swing points or trend beginnings, I find this

approach to be the most practical and based on my real-world experience.

Additionally,  I  employ  a  unique  color  scheme  for  clarity.  VWAP  (anchored  to  a  date)  with

deviations  is  depicted  in  yellow  and  grey,  while  Anchored  VWAP  without  deviations  is

represented in blue. This visual distinction aids me in differentiating between the two.

Now, let's dive into the strategies!

VWAP Rotation strategy

This strategy is tailored for a market that is moving sideways, which indicates it's in a rotation

phase. In this scenario, we need the 1st deviations to move horizontally.

When the market behaves like this, the price typically stays within the upper and lower 1st

deviation lines. The upper 1st deviation acts as a Resistance level, while the lower 1st deviation

serves as a Support level.

49

Upper deviation = Resistance

VWAP = Take Profit

Lower deviation = Support

Executing this strategy is quite straightforward

When the price touches the lower 1st deviation from above (acting as Support), enter a Long

trade.

When the price touches the upper 1st deviation from below (functioning as Resistance), enter

a Short trade.

For your Take Profit target, consider using the yellow VWAP line.

Time frame

For intraday trading, I opt for the Weekly VWAP, anchored to the start of the week, and use a

30-minute  time  frame.  While  Daily  VWAP  with  a  5-minute  time  frame  is  also  an  option,  I

personally prefer the Weekly VWAP because it tends to be less volatile and provides what I

consider more reliable trading signals.

For swing trading, I turn to the Yearly VWAP, anchored to the beginning of the year, and use a

daily time frame.

It's important to emphasize that this strategy for a market that is in a rotation phase, meaning

the price is moving sideways, and the 1st deviations are moving horizontally.

50

Example #1: VWAP Rotation strategy

The  chart  below  illustrates  S&P  500  futures  using  a  30-minute  time  frame.  Initially,  the  1st

deviations are very close to each other, forming a tight channel. This is a typical occurrence,

and it's essential to be patient as you wait for them to develop before trading with them.

At the beginning of the week, there was a trend in the market, making it unsuitable for this

strategy. However, as the week progressed, the market transitioned into a rotation phase. Both

deviations started moving sideways, and the price moved between them, creating the ideal

conditions for this rotation-based strategy.

Once  the price  started  to  rotate,  it  responded  nicely  to  the  lower 1st  deviation,  presenting

several opportunities for Long trade entries. Subsequently, there were two signals for Short

trades  (the  second  signal  was  less  favorable  as  the  price  moved  significantly  beyond  the

deviation).

Finally, there was a signal for a Long trade.

For all of these trades, the VWAP was the ideal place to set your Take Profit target.

Long  trades  (although  one  trade  did  not  work  out  as  expected),  and  there  have  been  two

opportunities for Short trades.

opportunities  for  Short  trades.  However,  once  the  price  moved  below  the  1st  deviation,  it

signified the end of the Rotation strategy and the beginning of the VWAP Trend strategy (which

we will discuss further later).

VWAP Trend strategy

This strategy is designed for a market that is in a trend. In such cases, the 1st deviations tend

to move more vertically.

When the market is set like this, the price often remains either above the upper deviation or

below the lower deviation.

For a Long Trade Scenario:

Look for the upper deviation to trend upward (moving vertically).

Confirm that the price is positioned above the upper Deviation.

Enter a Long trade when the price touches the upper deviation from above.

For a Short Trade Scenario:

Observe the lower deviation trending downward (moving vertically).

Verify that the price is situated below the lower Deviation.

Enter a Short trade when the price touches the lower deviation from below.

As this is a trend-based strategy, it offers the advantage of trading with a positive Risk Reward

Ratio (RRR) and allows for trailing your Take Profit. The objective here is to enter a trend during

a pullback and capture as much profit as possible!

Confluences with other strategies

So far, we've covered some simple VWAP trading  strategies that are solely based on VWAP

itself. You can apply these strategies as I've demonstrated, and they tend to yield good results

as  they've  been  thoroughly  battle-tested.  However,  because  these  strategies  are  relatively

simple,  they  may  not  always  produce  consistent  outcomes.  There  will  be  times  when  you

receive multiple trading signals, and each of them turns out to be a winner, but there will also

be cases where the price doesn't react to the VWAP or its Deviations, leaving you questioning

whether the strategy has stopped working or if something is amiss.

In the long run, these strategies can provide favorable results, but if you're seeking greater

consistency and a higher win rate, I recommend combining VWAP setups with other unrelated

trading setups. This is the approach I personally follow, and it has delivered the best results for

me.

I prefer to combine VWAP with Volume Profile and Price Action setups. When two or more

independent trading setups align to point to the same Support or Resistance level, I refer to it

as a "confluence". These confluences provide strong zones to trade from.

Now, I'll introduce you to my most favored Price Action and Volume Profile setups, and then

we'll combine them with VWAP setups. It might seem a bit complicated, but don't worry, it's

not as complex as it appears. Once you grasp this approach, you'll be amazed by the results it

can achieve!

Price  Action  setup:  Support  becomes  Resistance  (and

vice versa)

This is one of my favorite Price Action strategies, and I usually spot this setup in the charts

nearly every day, offering numerous trading opportunities.

This setup can work in both directions, where Support turns into Resistance and vice versa.

Here's how to identify and trade it:

Start by observing the price strongly reacting or sharply moving away from a particular level

on the chart. This strong reaction signifies the presence of strong Support or Resistance in that

area, and the market is responding to it.

While  one  significant  reaction  is  enough,  it's  even  better  if  there  are  two  or  more  strong

reactions around the same area.

After identifying such a strong zone, wait for the price to go through it. You want to see the

price break through this strong Support or Resistance level.

Despite  breaching  the  level,  this  level  remains  significant  and  strong.  The  reason  is  that

breaking such a Support or Resistance demands a substantial push, involving a considerable

amount of strength and trading volume from either strong buyers or sellers. When the price

revisits this zone, it tends to be defended because it was a crucial level in the past. This is how

Support can become Resistance and vice versa.

Once you've identified a Support becoming Resistance (or Resistance becoming support) level,

wait for the price to return to this level, and that's when you enter your trade.

This setup is effective across various timeframes. Personally, I prefer to look for it on daily and

30-minute charts.

Although it may seem like there are six somewhat complex and possibly confusing steps to

explain, I'll provide you with a few examples, and I'm confident everything will become crystal

clear!

59

Example #1: Support becomes Resistance (and vice versa)

While  I'm  writing  this,  I  just  executed  a  trade  based  on  the  same  concept  –  what  a  nice

coincidence! Allow me to walk you through what I did.

Here's  a  30-minute  chart  of  NZD/JPY.  There  was  a  zone  on  the  chart  where  the  price  had

strongly  bounced off  twice  in  the past.  This  suggests  that  in  the  past,  it served  as  a  strong

Resistance  level.  However,  this  Resistance  level  was  breached,  transforming  it  into  a  new

Support level.

All I had to do was wait until the price revisited this zone, and that's when I entered a Long

trade.

Price was reacting to this level.
This means it was a Resistance in
the past.

Resistance

Long

Price went through Resistance (and stayed above
it). This turned the Resistance into a new Support.

This illustrates the Long trade scenario of this setup, where a previously breached Resistance

level becomes a new Support. Additionally, there was another setup that further reinforced

this Support, which was a Volume Profile setup, but I'll delve into that later on.

60

Example #2: Support becomes Resistance (and vice versa)

Here's a 30-minute chart of S&P 500 futures. The price made strong reactions in the area of

the red level I've highlighted in the image. To be precise, it wasn't necessarily hitting the exact

level, but rather the area around it. That's because Supports and Resistances are not precise

points; they represent zones.

Therefore, the price's strong reactions to this zone indicated that the market considered it as

a  Resistance.  However,  once  this  zone  was  breached,  it  turned  into  a  new  Support  level,

presenting a nice opportunity for a Long trade.

Price was reacting to this zone. This
means it was a Resistance in the past.

Example #3: Support becomes Resistance (and vice versa)

Here's another example from the daily chart of Bitcoin. The price made multiple reactions to

the  red  zone  I've  highlighted  in  the  image.  This  recurrent  behavior  indicated  that  the  zone

served  as  a  strong  Resistance  level.  However,  once  the  price  decisively  broke  through  this

Resistance and remained above it, the zone turned into a new Support.

Later on, this newly formed Support level was tested, presenting a good opportunity to enter

a Long trade.

Price was reacting to this zone. This
means it was a Resistance in the past.

Example #4: Support becomes Resistance (and vice versa)

The  final  example  is  a  30-minute  chart  of  EUR/USD,  and  it  presents  a  reverse  scenario

compared to what I've previously shown.

In this case, the price rebounded from the green line, forming a significant daily low. This action

indicated that the market considered this level as strong support. However, the following day,

during  a  macroeconomic  news  release,  this  Support  was  breached,  turning  it  into  a  new

Resistance.

This illustrates the Short trade scenario of the setup, where a previously breached Support

level becomes a new Resistance.

Price went through Support (and stayed
below it). This turned the Support into a
new Resistance.

Volume Profile Trend setup

I  have  several  Volume  Profile  setups  that  I  enjoy  trading,  and  I've  detailed  them

comprehensively in my Volume Profile trading book. However, there's one particular setup,

the Volume Profile Trend Setup, that pairs exceptionally well with VWAP.

I say it works best because VWAP setups tend to excel in markets that are trending (except for

the VWAP rotation setup). My Volume Profile Trend Setup is specifically designed for use in

trending  markets.  This  is  why I  seek  instances  where  these  two  setups align,  indicating  the

same Support or Resistance level, and use them as trade signals.

Now, let me clarify how the Volume Profile Trend Setup works.

Volume Profile trend setup explained

I use the Trend Setup when the market is in a strong trend. A strong trend means that either

buyers or sellers are more aggressive compared to the other side. In an uptrend, it's aggressive

buyers pushing the price up, while in a downtrend, it's aggressive sellers driving it down.

When you look at the volumes traded in a trend, you'll usually see that Volume Profile is rather

thin.  That's  because  trends  move  quickly,  and  there  isn't  enough  time  for  big  players  to

accumulate their positions.

But within a trend, there are moments when the price takes a breather and slows down a bit.

During  these  pauses,  traders  and  investors  have  a  chance  to  add  to  their  positions.  These

moments  create  what  we  call  a  "volume  vluster"  within  the  trend.  It's  important  that  this

volume cluster forms within the ongoing trend, indicating that aggressive market participants

are adding to their existing positions.

64

Long trade scenario:

If a volume cluster forms within a strong uptrend, it suggests that buyers were adding more to

their Long positions as the price moved higher. If the price retraces to the volume cluster, it's

likely to find support there and continue moving higher. In an uptrend, we consider the volume

cluster  as  a  Support  level,  and  I  prefer  to  enter  my  trades  at  the  beginning  of  this  volume

cluster.

Uptrend

 cluster

Support

Long

65

Short trade scenario:

If a volume cluster forms within a strong downtrend, it suggests that sellers were adding more

to their Short positions there as the price was falling. If the price retraces to the volume cluster,

it's likely to encounter resistance at that level and continue moving downward. In a downtrend,

we view the volume cluster as a Resistance point, and I prefer to enter my trades at the start

of this volume cluster.

Now that we've covered the theory, let's delve into a few practical examples!

66

Example #1: Volume Profile Trend setup

Here's  a  30-minute  chart  of  ES  (S&P 500  futures).  It's  in  a  strong  downtrend,  which  means

we're hunting for important volume clusters within this trend to take Short trades.

On this chart, there are two notable volume clusters that have formed during the downtrend.

The first one has already been tested, and the price responded well to it.

The second volume cluster, however, hasn't been tested yet. It acts as an active Resistance

level, and if the price reaches it, we expect a reaction.

Combos of multiple trading setups

So far, we've learned about these individual trading setups:

•  Anchored VWAP  (anchored  to  important  dates, swing  points,  start  of  trends,  macro

news candles, heavy volume zones, gaps, earnings)

•  Trading with 1st VWAP Deviations

•  Price Action setup

•  Volume Profile setup

Now, I'll show you how to combine these setups to identify very strong Support and Resistance

zones.  Combining  these  methods  often  results  in  more  consistent  and  effective  outcomes

compared to using each one individually.

The process is straightforward. You examine a chart and search for areas where two or more

trading strategies indicate a Support or Resistance level. For instance, if both the Anchored

VWAP and Volume Profile setups highlight the same level (or very close), the likelihood of that

level being significant increases compared to when only one strategy identifies it.

Keep  in  mind  that  these  setups  don't  have  to  align  precisely  at  the  exact  level,  but  if  they

converge within the same general area, it can be considered a confluence. Let me clarify with

a couple of examples.

70

Example #1: Multiple setups combo

Here's a daily chart for Mondelez International, where we're combining two trading strategies:

VWAP and Volume Profile. The VWAP is anchored to the day when earnings were reported,

making  it  an  important  point  of  reference.  When  the  price  moves  away  from  the  VWAP,  it

tends to come back for a retest.

What's  especially  interesting  here  is  that  during  this  pullback  to  the  VWAP,  there's  also  a

Volume  Profile  Trend  Setup  lining  up  with  this  level.  In  simple  terms,  both  indicators  are

pointing  to  the  same  Support  level.  This  alignment  of  two  independent  trading  strategies

makes  this  level  even  more  significant  and  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  successful  price

reaction.

Example #2: Multiple setups combo

Let's check out Bitcoin's daily chart, where we're using two good trading strategies  – VWAP

and Volume Profile. We've set the VWAP based on a strong volume zone that appeared just

before a significant uptrend.

At first, the price was above the VWAP, indicating strong buyer interest. But later on, it dropped

and came closer to the VWAP, making a pullback.

What's intriguing here is that during this pullback, another Support level popped up thanks to

the Volume Profile Trend Setup, which focuses on trading volume clusters. When both of these

setups highlight the same Support level, it becomes a robust Support zone.

In simpler terms, when two strategies agree on a level, it becomes a strong level with a better

chance of a successful reaction.

Example #3: Multiple setups combo

Let's take a look at this 5-minute chart for S&P futures (ES). We're using two trading strategies

here – VWAP and Price Action.

At the start of the day, the price was moving around the VWAP without a clear direction. But

later  on,  it  took  a  significant  drop  below  the  VWAP,  signaling  that  the  sellers  were  taking

control.

Now, when the price made a pullback to the VWAP, something interesting occurred. The Price

Action setup also indicated a broken Support level, which had now become a new Resistance

level.

To put it simply, two different strategies were both pointing out the same thing – there was a

strong Resistance zone at that level. This made it a good signal for a short trade.

Example #4: Multiple setups combo

Let's take a look at this daily chart of GBP/USD, where we're using two trading strategies  –

VWAP and Price Action.

The  VWAP  was  initially  set  at  the  start  of  the  year,  representing  the  Yearly  VWAP.  In  the

beginning,  the  price  was  moving  in  a  narrow  range.  But  then,  there  was  a  sudden  drop,

signaling the start of a new trend.

After this drop, we had a good opportunity for a Short trade when the price retraced to the

1st deviation from below. While this trade relied solely on the VWAP strategy and didn't involve

multiple setups, it still had potential.

However, the second test was even more interesting. This is where the Price Action strategy

came into play. It highlighted a broken Support level that had turned into a Resistance level.

When both of these setups pointed to the same Resistance zone, it became an excellent point

to enter a Short trade.

Example #5: Multiple setups combo

Let's check out Tesla's daily stock chart, where we're using two trading strategies – VWAP and

Price Action.

Think of VWAP like an average yearly price. In the beginning of the year, the price was above

VWAP,  suggesting  that  buyers  were  in  charge.  Initially,  there  were  two  opportunities  to

consider a Long trade when the price pulled back.

However, the third pullback was more interesting. This time, it aligned perfectly with another

strategy  –  Price  Action.  This  approach  identified  a  previous  Resistance  level  that  had  now

turned into a Support level.

What made this Support level special was that it matched with the Yearly VWAP. When two

different strategies point to the same level, it creates a strong signal. And as you can see on

the chart, the price reacted positively to it.

Anchored VWAP.

The first VWAP, called the Yearly VWAP, starts from the beginning of the year. It didn't have

much impact on the price until it aligned with the second VWAP.

The second VWAP is anchored at a significant high point in the chart.

As these two VWAPs moved closer together, they created a powerful Resistance zone. When

the price retraced or pulled back to this zone, it triggered a positive response.

Trade entry confirmation

There are several methods to determine whether to enter a trade when it touches VWAP or

not. Let's go through them one by one and discuss their advantages and disadvantages:

Entering a trade at first touch

This approach is the riskiest, especially if you solely rely on VWAP setups without any other

supporting strategies.

In  simple  terms,  you  enter  a  trade  as  soon  as  it  touches  the  VWAP  line,  without  any

confirmation.

This means you trade every signal blindly.

Using this method, you'll have the most trades, but your results won't be consistent. Yes, there

will be times when almost every trade is a winner, leading to winning streaks. However, there

will also be times when you'll face losses, question the strategy, and have a tough time. Your

results won't be reliable.

Consistency is crucial in trading because it allows you to have more confidence in your strategy

and gradually increase your trade sizes.

I do not recommend trading this way. While it's the easiest, it's also the riskiest. As traders, we

must control our risks, and this approach doesn't provide that.

77

Entering a trade at first touch – with combos of multiple
setups
Entering a trade as soon as the price touches VWAP can be risky. However, it's a different story

when you have a combination of multiple independent trading setups aligning together. This

is much more reliable!

Personally, I don't have any issues with entering a trade at first touch if the price reaches a

level that's a strong Support or Resistance indicated by multiple trading setups. These signals

are extremely strong, and the success rate is much more consistent.

So,  if  you  want  to  trade  at  first  touch,  go  for  it,  but  make  sure  you're  using  these  kinds  of

powerful combinations.

Entering a trade after a successful reaction

Confirming  your  trade  entry  by observing how  the  market  reacts  to  a  level  is  a  proper  and

logical approach. It's a straightforward way to ensure you're making the right move. Here's

how you can do it:

1.  When  the price  reaches  your  Support  or Resistance  level,  take  the  time to  watch how  it

responds.

2. If the price does react to the level, meaning it bounces off it as expected, that's your signal

to enter the trade.

3. I recommend waiting for one positive candle to show that the price is indeed reacting to the

level. When that candle closes, and a new one opens, it's time to execute your trade.

4.  For  a  long  trade  entry  from  a  VWAP-based  support,  look  for  one  bullish  candle  to  close

ABOVE the Support level.

78

5. For a short trade, watch for a bearish candle to close below the Resistance level.

Observing these candlestick patterns and reacting accordingly provides a reliable confirmation

for your trade entries.

79

Stop loss placement:

One advantage of this approach is that it provides a clear and effective location for placing

your  Stop  Loss.  You  should position  your  Stop  Loss  behind  the  swing point  of  the  market's

reaction, which I refer to as the "Reaction Point." This method ensures that you always have a

well-defined Stop Loss placement.

80

Disadvantage: missing out

One  potential  drawback  of  this  approach  is  that  you  might  miss  out  on  some  of  the  initial

reaction  because  you  enter  the  trade  later.  However,  the  benefit  is  that  you  can  be  more

confident that the market is indeed reacting to the level. It's a trade-off between entering a

bit late but with better confirmation.

The most frustrating situation you might encounter is when the confirming candle is very large,

causing you to miss a significant part of the expected move. Unfortunately, there isn't much

you can do about this, and you'll need to accept that it can happen occasionally.

We missed all this because of

Time frame

I  recommend  sticking  to  a  single  time  frame  when  using  this  confirmation  method.  For

instance, if you are working with 30-minute charts, you should look for a bullish 30-minute

candle closing above the Support for a long trade confirmation, not a different time frame like

a 5-minute candle. Consistency within the same time frame you initially analyzed is a safer

approach.

81

If  you  want  to  be  more  aggressive,  you  can  switch  to  a  slightly  faster  time  frame  for

confirmation, but I advise against drastic changes. For example, if your initial analysis is on a

30-minute time frame, consider confirmation on a 15-minute time frame (a very aggressive

approach would be on a 5-minute time frame).

Order Flow confirmation

My preferred method for confirming trade entries is using Order Flow analysis. It's the most

advanced  approach  and  requires  Order  Flow  software  and  knowledge  of  how  to  use  it.

However, once you master it, this method can become your favorite way to confirm trades.

Order Flow analysis displays all executed orders in the market, allowing you to track the actions

of major trading institutions that influence and manipulate markets. You can see where these

significant players are placing their large orders.

For example, if the price reaches a VWAP-based support, and you observe a sudden surge in

activity by major players around that level (with significant volumes being traded), it serves as

a  strong  confirmation  that  these  institutions  recognize  the  Support  and  are  interested  in

trading it. Order Flow enables you to follow institutional traders' actions and trade alongside

them, rather than against them.

82

There  are  numerous  Order  Flow  strategies  and  confirmations  you  can  use,  but  this  book

provides  only  a  brief  introduction.  If  you  wish  to  explore  Order  Flow  analysis  further  and

receive proper training, you can visit www.orderflow.com.

Here are a couple of examples of how to use Order Flow to confirm trade entries:

Example #1: Order Flow trade entry confirmation

One  of  my  favorite  confirmations  using  Order  Flow  analysis  is  called  "Absorption."  In  the

example below, you can see the price rising when suddenly there are significant volumes on

both the Bid (left) and Ask (right) sides of the Order Flow footprint.

This situation indicates that buyers are aggressively trying to push the price up (visible on the

Ask  side,  or  the  right  side  of  the  footprint),  but  at  the  same  time,  sellers  are  also  selling

aggressively,  as  evidenced  by  the  large  orders  on  the  Bid  side  (left  side  of  the  footprint).

Essentially, the sellers are absorbing the buying pressure.

When you observe this type of confirmation, known as absorption, occurring around a Support

or Resistance zone (such as one created by VWAP), it suggests that the price is likely to reverse.

Huge orders at Bid
and Ask = Absorption

Bid

Ask

These are called Footprints.

Bid (left side) = Aggressive sellers

Ask (right side) = Aggressive buyers

83

Example #2: Order Flow trade entry confirmation

The  example  below  illustrates  another  type  of  Order  Flow  confirmation,  known  as  "Limit

Order" confirmation.

In this scenario, you're looking for a significant order to appear near your Support or Resistance

zone, typically representing a Limit order placed by a major market participant, possibly a large

institutional trader.

In the image, you can see the price suddenly surging upwards, followed by the appearance of

a huge order of 353 contracts on the Ask side of the footprint. If this occurs around a robust

Resistance zone, there's a good chance that this significant order was a Sell Limit order.

In simple terms, a significant player was waiting at this Resistance level, and when the price

reached it, they initiated a pending Short trade.

This type of confirmation is valuable when considering whether to  take the trade or not. It

provides a clear signal that the level is being recognized by a major institutional trader, and the

price is expected to react to it.

Note: A Limit Sell order appears on the Ask side, while a Market Sell order appears on the Bid

side of the order flow footprint.

This confirmation needs to appear around
a strong Resistance level, such as one
based on VWAP. If it appears randomly on
the chart, the information it provides is
not very valuable.

Huge order at Ask
= Sell limit of a BIG
(institutional)
trader

84

Example #3: Order Flow trade entry confirmation

The chart below displays a 1-Minute chart (represented by the black line), and below it, the

green  line  represents  a  Cumulative  Delta  chart.  While  not  exactly  an  Order  Flow  chart,

Cumulative Delta provides information derived from the Order Flow (and it's also a part of my

custom-made order flow software).

Cumulative Delta essentially illustrates the difference between bid and ask, which boils down

to  the  distinction  between  aggressive  buyers  and  sellers.  When  Cumulative  Delta  rises,  it

indicates  that  aggressive  buyers  are  in  control,  whereas  a  decline  suggests  that  aggressive

sellers are taking the lead.

I use this chart to compare price movements with Cumulative Delta. Most of the time, these

two  charts  move  in  sync,  following  the  same  direction.  However,  there  are  instances  of

divergence when the price moves differently from Cumulative Delta.

These divergences catch my attention. Why? Because, typically, the price tends to align with

Cumulative  Delta,  and  when  a  divergence  occurs,  it  often  signals  that  the  price  will  soon

change course to follow the Delta.

When I spot such a divergence, especially around a significant Support or Resistance level (like

one based on VWAP), I consider it a strong confirmation that encourages me to enter the trade.

In the picture below, you can see a moment when the price is decreasing while Cumulative

Delta is on the rise. Not long after this, the price changes its direction to align with the Delta.

85

Price is dropping while Cumulative Delta is rising = divergence.
This means that the price should turn and go up.

Cumulative Delta is
showing aggressive buyers

Keep in mind that a divergence is a strong signal for a trend change, but it's most effective

when the price is close to a strong Support or Resistance area, such as a VWAP-based Support

or Resistance zone. This is when it works best.

Take Profit placement

There are several methods for determining where to place your Take Profit in trading, and they

all share a fundamental rule that applies not only to VWAP but also to Volume Profile, Order

Flow, or simple Price Action trading.

Here's the rule: Always exit your trade a bit before it reaches a significant barrier which could

prevent  the  price  moving  further.  These  barriers  are  strong  Support  or  Resistance  levels

identified through Price Action, VWAP, or Volume Profile analysis.

I use this approach because when the price approaches such a barrier, there's a risk that it

might  react  and reverse at  that  Support  or  Resistance.  I  prefer  to  exit  my  trade before  this

potential reversal occurs.

86

Price Action based Take Profit

Earlier in this book, I talked about a Price Action setup where Support can become Resistance

or  vice  versa.  These  setups  often  point  to  important  levels  where  the  price  might  change

direction.

Now, let me explain how I use this setup to exit my trades using an example.

Picture this: You're in a Long trade which is in an open profit. But suddenly, you notice that the

price is getting very close to a zone where there was a Price Action Support that has turned

into Resistance. You don't want to take the risk of the price turning around at this Resistance

level and wiping out your trade, right? So, you exit the trade a couple of pips (just to be sure)

before the Resistance.

Example #1: Price Action based Take Profit

In the picture below, you can see the price reacting to the 1st VWAP Deviation, represented

by the grey line. By the way, this setup is known as the VWAP Trend Setup.

A  good  spot  to  consider  taking  your  profit  is  at  a  point  where  previous  Support  has  now

become Resistance. This Resistance level can act as a barrier. It might stop the Long trade from

continuing upward and could cause the price to reverse downward.

Example #2: Price Action based Take Profit

The picture below shows the price reacting to the 1st VWAP deviation from below (this is the

result of an old Price Action Resistance being breached.

88

VWAP based Take Profit

The same concept applies to VWAP-based Take Profit. It's all about quitting your trade before

it hits a barrier. In this case, that barrier is the VWAP-based Support or Resistance.

Let's say you're in a Short trade, and it's going well. Now, you're thinking about where to close

the trade and lock in your profit. The ideal spot is before the price gets to the VWAP Support.

It doesn't matter which specific VWAP strategy you use to identify that Support – it could be

based on swing points, volume, weekly VWAP, and so on. But when you spot a VWAP support,

it's a smart move to exit the trade a bit early, just a few pips before the price reaches it. Why?

Because there's a risk that the price will react to this support, reverse, and potentially ruin

your trade.

Example #1: VWAP-based Take Profit

The  picture below  illustrates  the VWAP  Rotation  setup  with  the  price  hitting  the 1st  VWAP

deviation from below and reacting to it. In this scenario, the best place to take your profit is at

the VWAP line (yellow line).

Example #2: VWAP-based Take Profit

The picture below displays the VWAP anchored at a significant swing low. After some time,

there is a pullback to this VWAP, providing a nice Long trade entry.

The logical trade exit is determined by the VWAP anchored at a crucial zone - the beginning of

a strong trend. In this case, it was best to close the trade as soon as it reached this significant

VWAP-based Resistance.

I'd like to mention a quick tip here. If you start drawing all the possible VWAPs and anchored

VWAPs on your charts, you'll end up with a lot of potential barriers. This could lead to exiting

your trade prematurely because you'll see barriers every few pips, right? So, my advice is not

to  clutter  your  charts  with  too  many  VWAP  levels.  Focus  on  the  very  strong  VWAP  levels

(signals) when you're looking for potential barriers to exit your trade.

91

Volume Profile based Take Profit

Once more, with this method, we're searching for a barrier that might obstruct our successful

trade, and we exit the trade before the price reaches this barrier. In this scenario, the barrier

is represented by a heavy volume zone, which you can identify using Volume Profile.

These heavy volume zones often serve as strong Supports and Resistances. That's why it's a

good practice to exit your trade a few pips before the price reaches this barrier.

Example #1: Volume Profile-based Take Profit

The  picture  below  shows  the  price  responding  positively  to  a  weekly  VWAP  (yellow  line),

resulting in a significant upward movement. The optimal point to exit this trade is when the

price approaches a heavy volume zone. This heavy-volume zone acts as a Resistance (barrier),

which is why it's advisable to exit the trade a few pips before reaching it.

Example #2: Volume Profile-based Take Profit

The image below demonstrates a successful reaction to the Weekly VWAP (yellow line). The

best spot to take your profit is just a few pips before the price hits the first heavy volume zone,

acting as a barrier (Support).

Although  this  Support  didn't  exactly  push  the  price  upward,  it  did  slow  down  the  market's

momentum, resulting in a sideways movement. In my view, it's wiser to exit the trade at this

point rather than spending hours in a sideways price range with no clear direction.

ATR based Take Profit

If,  for  some  reason,  you  prefer  a  fixed  Take  Profit  rather  than  the  methods  I  previously

mentioned,  you  might  find  this  approach  suitable.  It  relies  on determining  your  Take Profit

using the average daily volatility of the instrument you are trading.

Let's begin with an example. Suppose EUR/USD exhibits an average daily volatility of 100 pips.

As an intraday trader, you would aim to use 10-20% of the average daily volatility as your Take

Profit. In this case, your Take Profit would range from 10-20 pips.

Here's how to do it:

Calculating the average daily volatility is a breeze using the ATR (Average True Range) indicator,

which is readily available for free in most trading platforms.

Set the ATR for an extended period, like 200. Load approximately 300-500 days' worth of data

on your charts in the daily timeframe, and note the average ATR value for this period. This

value represents the average daily volatility.

To express this value in pips, multiply the ATR number by 10,000.

For intraday trades, I recommend setting your Take Profit at around 10-20% of the average

daily ATR.

94

In the example below, there are 500 daily candles for EUR/USD, and the ATR indicator is set

to a 200-period timeframe. The ATR value is approximately 0.0085. To find the average daily

volatility for EUR/USD in pips, multiply this number by 10,000, resulting in 85 pips. With this

example, your intraday Take Profit values should fall within the 8.5 to 17 pip range.

Stop Loss placement

The key rule to remember when setting your Stop Loss is to always position it BEHIND a barrier,

which is represented by a Support or Resistance zone. This barrier can be identified through

Price Action, VWAP, or Volume Profile analysis.

The reason for putting your Stop Loss behind a barrier is to keep your trade safe. A barrier is a

zone  that  the  price  should  not  cross.  If  the  price  goes  past  it,  it  could  mean  the  trend  is

changing. Think of the barrier as a safety net for your trade. If it gets crossed, it's a good idea

to exit your trade because once it's crossed, we don't know where the price might go next.

95

Price Action based Stop Loss placement

When you set your Stop Loss using Price Action, a logical choice is to place it at a swing point

or a significant high/low. This makes sense because those points were crucial in the past, and

the  price  changed  direction  there.  The  assumption  is  that  these  levels  will  continue  to  be

important in the future, and ideally, the price shouldn't reach them if the trend is to continue.

Example #1: Price Action Stop Loss placement

The picture below shows a VWAP Rotation setup and a successful reaction to the 1st VWAP

deviation. Stop Loss for this trade should be placed above the nearest swing point.

97

VWAP based Stop Loss placement

VWAP and its Deviations act like strong Support or Resistance zones, which can be thought of

as barriers. It's a wise approach to place your Stop Loss behind one of these barriers.

Example #1: VWAP Stop Loss placement

The image below displays a good opportunity for a Long trade. This is based on a pullback to a

VWAP that's anchored at an important swing low.

Even though this VWAP has been tested before, it still acts as a reliable support. As the price

continues to rise, the VWAP also rises and serves as a solid barrier. You can place your Stop

Loss behind it and adjust it higher as the price goes up.

As you can observe, the price eventually moves significantly above the VWAP. In such a case, I

recommend searching for other Support levels to move your Stop Loss to because the VWAP

is now too far away, and having the Stop Loss behind it would be too distant.

The price is too far from VWAP. At this
point, it's better to use another Stop
Loss placement method.

Long

Stop Loss goes below this VWAP line

VWAP anchored at candle that formed swing low

98

Example #2: VWAP Stop Loss placement

The picture below shows two lines: a blue line - VWAP, anchored at an important swing low,

and a yellow line - Weekly VWAP. The yellow line is automatically calculated from the beginning

of the week, and there are also two grey lines representing its deviations.

To enter a trade, I look for a pullback to the VWAP anchored at the swing point. At this point I

recommend placing Stop Loss below the blue VWAP line.

However, as the price keeps going up, the Stop Loss initially placed below the VWAP (blue line)

becomes too far away. In this situation, it's a good idea to find another level to use as a Stop

Loss.

I recommend using the first VWAP and its deviations at this point. Initially, you can place the

Stop Loss below the lower deviation. When the price continues to rise, you can then move it

up below the yellow Weekly VWAP line. As the price goes even higher, you can further adjust

the Stop Loss below the upper deviation. Eventually, the Stop Loss at this level is hit, marking

a successful trade exit.

Example #2: VWAP Stop Loss placement

The picture below shows a short trade example using the VWAP Trend setup.

Here, the price is trending downwards, going below a lower VWAP deviation (represented by

a grey line). To enter a short trade, we wait for the price to pull back and touch this lower

deviation from below.

Once this happens, a strong downtrend begins. At the start of this downtrend, I anchor the

blue VWAP as a reference point for my Stop Loss. If the price crosses this level, I no longer

want  to  stay  in  the  short  trade  I  entered  earlier.  This  breach  would  signal  that  the  selling

pressure has subsided, and there's no reason to continue with the trade.

Volume Profile based Stop Loss placement

As mentioned earlier, heavy volume zones are powerful barriers. It's logical to place your

Stop Loss behind these barriers. If the barrier gets breached, it's usually a sign that the trade

might not go as expected, and it's best to exit.

Example #1: Volume Profile Stop Loss placement

The  image  below  displays  a  Long  trade  based  on  the VWAP Trend  setup.  The  price  is  in  an

uptrend,  and  then  it  makes  a  pullback  to  the  upper  deviation  of  the  Weekly  VWAP.  This  is

where we decide to enter the trade.

The volume-based Stop Loss is placed behind a heavy volume zone which formed within the

uptrend. If this barrier is breached, it signifies that sellers have taken control, and there's no

good reason to stay in a Long trade anymore.

Example #2: Volume Profile Stop Loss placement

and cause the price to move upward.

Stop Loss placement – combined barriers

You should aim to place your Stop Loss behind a very strong barrier. This barrier could be a

combination of elements like a heavy volume zone and a swing point or a heavy volume zone

and VWAP. The stronger the barrier, the better.

However, don't set your Stop Loss too far away because if you're trailing your trade in a trend

and it reverses, you don't want to lose all your profits. So, if there isn't a super strong barrier

nearby, a weaker one that's closer will suffice.

Here are some examples of these combined barriers:

Example #1: Stop Loss placement – combined barriers

The image below shows a VWAP Trend setup. In this scenario, the price is moving below the

Weekly VWAP deviation, then it pulls back to it, creating a nice opportunity for a short trade.

A suitable location for a Stop Loss is behind a heavy volume zone, and also behind a small

swing point, which is positioned just after this area with heavy volumes.

Example #2: Stop Loss placement – combined barriers

The image below displays a VWAP Rotation setup. Here, the price is moving inside a sideways

corridor formed by the upper and lower deviations of the Weekly VWAP. A signal to enter a

short trade occurs when the price touches the upper deviation from below.

A smart spot to set a Stop Loss is behind a heavy volume zone. This zone acts as a barrier. Also,

it is positioned above a swing point that the price should not cross if it is to continue moving

downward.

Short (VWAP

ATR based Stop Loss

An alternative approach to Stop Loss placement is to use a fixed Stop Loss based on the ATR

method,  which  I  previously  discussed  when  explaining  Take  Profit  placement.  For  intraday

trades, a reasonable Stop Loss size is typically around 10-20% of the average daily volatility of

the instrument you're trading.

You can also apply this approach when there isn't any other viable level (based on Price Action,

VWAP, or Volume Profile) to position your Stop Loss.

104

Trailing your trade

If  you  managed  to  jump  into  a  strong  trend,  for  example  at  a  pullback,  you  might  want  to

consider trailing your trade. Riding a strong trend can lead to a nice profit.

To trail your trade, continuously adjust your Stop Loss (moving it higher in an uptrend) as the

trend develops, like in this example:

Example #1: Trailing your trade

Price goes higher
and higher in
an uptrend

Long trade
 entry

SL #3

SL #2

SL #1 (initial Stop Loss)

SL #7

SL #6

SL #5

SL #4

However,  when  adjusting  your  Stop  Loss  during  a  trend,  remember  to  follow  the  rules  I

discussed earlier. This means always placing your Stop Loss behind a strong Price Action, VWAP,

or Volume Profile barrier.

105

Example #2: Trailing your trade

The example below illustrates the VWAP Trend setup, where the price reacts to the Weekly

VWAP deviation by touching it from below.

Initially, place your Stop Loss behind a barrier of heavy volumes, and also above an important

swing point.

As the price moves lower, the next sensible step is to adjust your Stop Loss above the next

swing point, the one that forms when the price reacts to the VWAP deviation. Additionally,

there is another heavy volume zone just below this swing point.

The  next  adjustment  for  your  Stop  Loss  should  be  behind  the  following  zone  with  heavy

volumes.

As the price continues to drop, the next move to safeguard your open profit even more is to

place  your  Stop  Loss  behind  the  next  heavy  volume  zone  that  forms  as  the  price  keeps

dropping.

This will be your final Stop Loss, as the price turns and touches it, which results in ending the

trade.

106

Example #3: Trailing your trade

In the example below, you can see a Long trade based on the VWAP Trend setup. The price

moves above the upper deviation of the Weekly VWAP and then retraces to it. This is the signal

to enter a Long trade.

In this example, we adjust the Stop Loss as the trend continues upwards. Here is a list of the

places  to  move  the  Stop  Loss  to,  along  with  a  brief  explanation  of  why to  move  it  to  each

specific location:

•

Initial Stop Loss (SL #1): This Stop Loss is placed behind a heavy volume zone.

•  SL #2: The Stop Loss is positioned behind a heavy volume barrier and below a swing

point.

•  SL #3: The Stop Loss is set behind a heavy volume barrier and below a swing point.

•  SL #4: The Stop Loss is positioned behind a heavy volume barrier.

•  SL #5: The Stop Loss is located behind a heavy volume barrier. This serves as the final

Stop Loss.

heavy
volume

SL #5

SL #4

SL #2

SL #1 (initial Stop Loss)

Avoid placing your Stop Loss too far away. If you're trailing your trade within a trend and the

trend suddenly reverses, having a very distant Stop Loss could lead to losing all your earned

profit. So, ideally, position your Stop Loss behind a strong barrier.

107

But  if  there's  no  exceptionally  strong  barrier  nearby,  a  weaker  one  closer  to  your  current

position should suffice.

Keep in mind that when trailing a trade within a trend, the key is to keep your position safe by

continuously adjusting your Stop Loss as the trend unfolds.

108

Start simple

As you can see from what I've shown you, there are many ways to handle your trades, from

deciding when to enter a trade to setting your profit target and stop loss. I understand it might

feel a bit overwhelming. Think of it as a list of options I can share based on my experience. You

don't have to use them all right away. Start by choosing one or two methods for entering and

exiting trades. Get really good at them until they feel natural to you. Then, if you want, you

can explore more of the possibilities I mentioned.

If I were to suggest a starting point, it would be this:

Trade Entry confirmation: Use the "Entering a trade after a successful reaction" approach. This

means entering a trade when you see the market reacting to Support/Resistance levels (like

when a candle closes above Support or below Resistance).

Stop  Loss  placement:  The  entry  method  I  mentioned  earlier  always  provides  a  good swing

point at the place where the price reacted. This is the right place for your Stop Loss.

Take Profit Placement: Aim for a Risk Reward Ratio (RRR) of 1. If your Stop Loss is, for example,

15 pips, set your Take Profit at 15 pips as well. It's easy!

Here's an example of how a trade like this could look like:

Entry Level: This short trade begins with a pullback to VWAP, which is anchored at the candle

that marked the start of a significant downtrend.

Confirmation  for  Entry:  To  confirm  the  trade  entry,  look  for  a  bullish  candle  closing  below

VWAP.

Stop Loss: Set at the reaction point.

Take Profit: Calculate it based on the Stop Loss to maintain a Risk Reward Ratio (RRR) of 1.

which is attached to a candle that created an important swing low.

The first and third trades are fast, in-and-out trades, while the second trade is a larger one that

takes more time to develop.

The confirmation for trade entry, placement of Stop Loss, and setting Take Profit are the same

as in the two earlier examples.

Money management

Managing your money is a crucial part of any trading plan. Even if your trading strategy is great,

you might lose money if you don't handle your money wisely.

Risk per trade

One of the most important things in managing your money while trading is how much you're

willing to risk on each trade. Here's a simple way to figure it out:

1. Start by backtesting your trading strategy. This will show you how your strategy performed

over time. The most crucial thing you'll learn from this is the biggest loss your strategy had in

the past, known as the "drawdown." Keep in mind that real trading conditions can be a bit

worse than what you see in the backtest, maybe around 20% worse.

2.  Let's  say  your  strategy's  worst  drawdown  was  6  consecutive  losses.  With  the 20%  factor

included, you'd estimate it as 6 x 1.2 = 7.2 losses. So, in the worst-case scenario, you can expect

7 losing trades in a row.

3.  Now,  think  about  how  much  of  your  trading  account  balance  you're  comfortable  losing

without getting too worried. This comfort level varies for each person. For example, you might

be okay with a 25% loss, but it could be different for someone else. An ambitious young trader

might be fine with a 50% drawdown, while a more experienced trader with a larger account

could be upset about a 10% loss.

4. Let's say you're mentally prepared for a 25% drawdown. In this case, those 7 losing trades

should represent the 25% loss. To calculate how much to risk on each trade, divide the 25% by

the number of trades, which is 7. This gives you the percentage of your trading capital to risk

per trade, which is 25% / 7 = 3.6%.

So, based on this simple calculation, you should risk 3.6% of your trading capital on each trade.

112

Position sizing

It's really important to use the same amount of money for all your trades. For instance, if you

decide to risk 2% of your account balance on each trade, make sure you always follow this rule.

The specific number of pips for your Stop Loss or Take Profit can vary from trade to trade, but

the percentage you risk should stay consistent.

Some traders like to change the amount they risk based on how confident they feel about a

trade. If they're really sure about a trade, they might risk more, and if they're unsure, they

might risk less. However, I'm not a fan of this approach for two reasons. First, feelings are hard

to measure, so it's not a reliable method. Second, in my experience, even trades that don't

look perfect can be just as successful as the ones that seem flawless. Actually, I've seen many

seemingly perfect trades go wrong. So, I prefer to stick to a solid plan and use the same position

size for all my trades.

113

Trade manager (software)

You might agree that calculating how much to trade for each trade can be a hassle. That's why

I made a tool called the Trade Manager. It does this math for me automatically. But that's not

all it does. Let me quickly tell you about its useful features.

1. Calculating Position Size: You can set how much you're willing to risk on each trade as a

percentage, and my tool figures out the lot size for you. This makes placing orders quick and

keeps your risk consistent.

2. Adjust Take Profit & Stop Loss: Easily change your Take Profit and Stop Loss levels with a

single click. You can see in real-time how it affects your Risk & Reward.

3. Simplified Limit Orders: Placing Limit Orders is made simple with just two clicks. You can

even set alerts for when the price gets close.

4. Protecting Your Trade: You can move your Stop Loss to the break-even point or where the

price first reacted with just one click to secure your position.

5. Partial Position Closure: Close a part of your trade with a single click. This is useful when

you need to act quickly.

114

6. Secure Limit Orders: This unique feature monitors macroeconomic news and temporarily

removes your Limit Orders a few minutes before major news releases to protect your positions

from sudden price spikes. After the news, it automatically puts your Limit Orders back in place!

Just a few testimonials on the course

Daniel Dellinger (US)

Prior to taking Dales Volume Profile and Order flow courses and uses his custom tools I was

doing  terrible.  I  wasn't  ready,  didn't  really  know  how  volume,  order  flow  related.  I  was  a

previous indicator trader (ema, rsi, macd) and never able to reach profitability.

I can say now, I am a profitable trader who no longer uses any indicator except the VWAP.

I also like that the courses didn't take months to complete. Dale gets to the point in his message

without labouring on with details that are not needed.

I highly recommend Trader Dales education and tools. I am very satisfied.

Daniele (IT):

I have been a member of the Trader Dale community for some time now, and I must say that

the quality of education, tools, and support provided is outstanding. The educational resources

offered by Trader Dale have greatly improved my trading skills and knowledge. The courses are

well-structured, comprehensive, and easy to follow, making it accessible even for beginners

like myself.

Corey Cepeda (US)

The video content is super easy to digest and understand. Any combination of material will

raise your trading IQ. I have seen a great uptick in winning trades with Dale's system. I expect

great things as I understand more.

Chucks Ihearahu (GB)

I find your course excellent and of great value for the money compared to other online courses

I have looked into. Dale keeps it simple and updates you every day with levels that work.

Wonderful experience. Everything that one trader should need to know before starting trading

on one place from literature to implementing real strategies with some sophisticated, real and

advances tools. It's just everything clicks after the course. The support team was unimaginable

fast and responsive on every question that I have on my mind. All in one, just worth the time

to  spend  if  anyone  looking  for  good  and  effective  educational  background  before  starting

trading.

Mark Richberg (US)

WOW!! What a great experience I have had with Dale, this software and his customer support

over  the  years.  I  purchased  this  software  about  2  years  ago  after  I  read  his  free  ebook  on

Volume-based trading and Big institutions. What a great read.

I ended up purchasing ALL of his products (Volume, Order Flow Elite pack, Stock pack - all of

them) and I have not been disappointed!

Dale explains complex topics very clearly in his free articles and training videos. Over time (I

have watched all of his videos at least twice) I understand more and more and this has greatly

advanced my trading skills the last 2 years.

But  what  sets  Dale's  business  apart  is  his  customer  service.  He  always  answers  emails,

responds to service requests in his Discord chat (a group of his customers from around the

world!) quickly and effectively.

On the customer service note, his tech guy Jason just solved a MAJOR issue for me concerning

my Cumulative Delta indicator. That issue has been troubling me for YEARS and I could not

figure it out. There was a compatibility issue with other Indicators. I scheduled an appointment

through Dale's easy to use appointment system and JASON came to my rescue!

I cannot over emphasize Jason's patience, availability and technical expertise in both Dale's

software  and  NinjaTrader.  His  absolute  refusal  to  quit  until  the  problem  was  fixed  was

impressive and I am very grateful!

119

I  would  not  hesitate  to  give  both  Dale's  products  and  Jason's  Technical  support  skills,

knowledge and courtesy my highest recommendation!

Randy Latsch (US)

Dale puts out new levels daily so you can trade almost immediately while learning this strategy.

If you stay with his system long enough you can accurately trade most any market. Many tools

and indicators available with easy-to-understand videos. This course is very valuable even if

you have your own strategy, as you can use it for confluence or divergence. (I do) I have never

had an unanswered email. Communication is awesome. Thanks Dale

Frank Liu (US)

The contents of Trader Dale's courses are very clear-cut and logical. I feel they are suitable for

all  levels  of  experiences  in  trading.  On  top,  the  online  Support  is  very  resourceful  when

needed. I personally think Dale took quite a lot of time/efforts putting them together They are

really gold-stars, IMO.

Naomi (AU)

Trader  Dale  has  helped  me  become  a  more  confident  and  better  trader,  as  a  result  of  his

extensive educational offerings (courses, daily trading videos, and e-books). He does not stop

teaching - if something significant occurs in a particular market, he'll make a video the same

day to share with his members. Specifically, Dale taught me how to understand Price Action

and the rationales for price movement. Dale has responded quickly to my emails for 3 years.

I've purchased most of his courses and software, which I use to trade the ES (except cumulative

delta, which I found to be inaccurate on ES). Dale truly cares about retail traders, because he

knows the pitfalls of trading.
