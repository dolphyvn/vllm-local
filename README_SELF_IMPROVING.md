# 🧠 Self-Improving AI Trading Assistant

## 🎯 Overview

Your Local Financial Assistant has been upgraded with a **self-improving memory system** that not only remembers conversations but actively learns from corrections, feedback, and patterns to improve its reasoning over time without retraining the model.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Self-Improving Memory Layer**
- **Lesson Storage**: Structured storage of learned lessons and corrections
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring mistakes and successful strategies
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Applies learned lessons to improve future responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tracks lesson effectiveness over time

### 📊 **Multi-Modal Memory System**
- **ChromaDB**: Semantic search for contextual relevance
- **SQLite**: Structured lesson metadata and statistics
- **Vector Search**: Find relevant lessons based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Temporal Tracking**: All timestamps in ISO8601 UTC

### 🔄 **Feedback & Correction System**
- **User Feedback**: Rate lessons (1-5 stars) and provide comments
- **Correction Recording**: Store original vs. corrected responses
- **Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitor how well lessons work in practice
- **Automatic Lesson Extraction**: Derive lessons from user corrections

### 📈 **Analytics & Monitoring**
- **Lesson Statistics**: Track performance by category and effectiveness
- **Application Metrics**: Monitor when and how lessons are applied
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time status of all memory systems
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every memory save and lesson recall logged

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- All existing requirements (FastAPI, Ollama, ChromaDB)
- SQLite 3 (built into Python)
- Updated dependencies from the upgrade

### Upgrade Your System

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Restart Services**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh restart
   ```

3. **Test the System**
   ```bash
   python test_self_improving.py
   ```

## 📚 API Endpoints

### Lesson Management

#### Add a Lesson
```python
POST /lessons
{
  "title": "Risk Management Rule",
  "content": "Never risk more than 2% on any single trade",
  "category": "risk_management",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "tags": ["risk", "position_sizing", "trading"]
}
```

#### Search Lessons
```python
GET /lessons?query=risk&category=trading&limit=5
```

#### Add Feedback
```python
POST /lessons/{lesson_id}/feedback
{
  "rating": 5,
  "feedback_text": "Very helpful advice!",
  "helpful": true,
  "user_context": {"query_type": "risk_management"}
}
```

#### Add Correction
```python
POST /corrections
{
  "original_response": "Buy gold now",
  "corrected_response": "Consider buying gold with proper risk management",
  "correction_reason": "Risk management is essential",
  "conversation_id": "conv_123"
}
```

#### Get Statistics
```python
GET /lessons/stats
```

### Enhanced Chat with Lessons

The chat endpoints now automatically include relevant lessons in the context:

```python
POST /chat
{
  "message": "What should I consider for trading gold?",
  "memory_context": 3,  # Number of conversation memories
  "lesson_context": 2  # Number of lessons to include
}
```

The system will:
1. Retrieve relevant conversation memories
2. Find semantically related lessons
3. Include both in the prompt context
4. Apply lessons to improve reasoning

### Storage Strategy

| Component | Purpose | Technology | Query Method |
|------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Conversations** | Chat history context | ChromaDB | Semantic similarity |
| **Lessons** | Learned patterns | ChromaDB + SQLite | Semantic + Structured |
| **Feedback** | User ratings | SQLite | Relational queries |
| **Corrections** | Mistake fixes | SQLite | Temporal analysis |
| **Applications** | Usage tracking | SQLite | Performance metrics |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Enhanced config.json
```json
{
  "default_model": "phi3:latest",
  "memory_settings": {
    "collection_name": "financial_memory",
    "persist_directory": "./chroma_db"
  },
  "lesson_settings": {
    "database_path": "./lessons.db",
    "default_confidence": 0.7,
    "max_lesson_context": 2,
    "auto_extract_lessons": true
  }
}
```

### Lesson Categories

Predefined categories for organizing lessons:
- `risk_management` - Position sizing, stop-loss, portfolio risk
- `technical_analysis` - Indicators, patterns, strategies
- `market_psychology` - Emotions, discipline, patience
- `correction` - User corrections and improvements
- `strategy` - Trading approaches and methodologies
- `fundamentals` - Economic factors and analysis

## 📊 Usage Examples

### 1. Adding Trading Lessons

```python
# After a successful trade, save the lesson
lesson_data = {
    "title": "Gold Breakout Strategy",
    "content": "Wait for confirmation breakout above resistance with volume increase before entering long positions",
    "category": "strategy",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "tags": ["gold", "breakout", "volume", "confirmation"]
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/lessons", json=lesson_data)
```

### 2. Recording Corrections

When the AI makes a mistake and you correct it:

```python
correction_data = {
    "original_response": "Buy at market price immediately",
    "corrected_response": "Wait for pullback to support level before buying",
    "correction_reason": "Better entry price reduces risk",
    "conversation_id": "conversation_123"
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/corrections", json=correction_data)
```

### 3. Monitoring Lesson Effectiveness

```python
# After applying a lesson successfully
application_data = {
    "lesson_id": "lesson_456",
    "conversation_id": "conversation_789",
    "application_context": "Applied to EUR/USD trade setup",
    "outcome": "success",
    "effectiveness_rating": 5
}

response = requests.post(f"http://localhost:8080/lessons/{lesson_id}/apply",
                        json=application_data)
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Lesson Creation
1. **Be Specific**: "Use 2% stop-loss" vs "Use risk management"
2. **Include Context**: Add when and why the lesson applies
3. **Categorize Properly**: Use existing categories or create new ones
4. **Set Appropriate Confidence**: Higher confidence for proven strategies

### Feedback Quality
1. **Rate Honestly**: 1-5 stars should reflect actual helpfulness
2. **Provide Context**: Explain when the lesson was helpful
3. **Track Outcomes**: Record if applying the lesson worked

### Correction Analysis
1. **Identify Patterns**: Look for recurring mistakes
2. **Extract Principles**: Generalize from specific corrections
3. **Update Confidence**: Increase confidence for validated lessons
